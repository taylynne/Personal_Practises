# Book Tracker
#
# Main focus:
# Input book information:
# - Title
# - Author
# - Part of a series? What number?
# - When book was finished
#
# Compile information in a database & display facts:
# - number completed
# - Repeat authors/narrators?
# - YTD/# for current month
#
# Additional I'd like to attempt:
# Display information in neat/tidy UI
# Annnd therefore create UI for the program
# Scrape data about the books for:
#   + genre
#   + length?
#   + ratings?
#   + brief summaries?
#   + book cover
# Collect book covers to compile to a single large image
